## Hello! 🙋‍♀️

Hi everyone, my name is Macey and I am a current Applied Quantitative Economics graduate student at Pace University🏙

- I am interested in healthcare economics and have done research projects focused on maternal mortality.
- I am currently working on a thesis building on my previous work.
- I am excited to learn Python and further my skills with R.

Outside of school, I like to... 

- Run 🏃‍♀️ (I am training for a half marathon in April!)
- Try new restaurants/bars in NYC 🥂🍕
- Read and watch thrillers/mysteries 🔍
